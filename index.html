    <h2>The Crescent Shape:</h2>
    The name "croissant" means crescent in French, and the pastry is
    traditionally known for its crescent shape. Legend has it that the shape was
    inspired by the crescent moon, which is featured on the Turkish flag. Bakers
    in Vienna adopted the shape after fending off the Ottoman Empire in the 17th
    century.
