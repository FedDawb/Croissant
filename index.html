    The Crescent Shape: The name "croissant" means crescent in French, and the
    pastry is traditionally known for its crescent shape. Legend has it that the
    shape was inspired by the crescent moon, which is featured on the Turkish
    flag. Bakers in Vienna adopted the shape after fending off the Ottoman
    Empire in the 17th century.
